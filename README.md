# Triviathon
Triviathon is a marathon-themed trivia game powered by Ruby on Rails and SQLite on the server-side and Vanilla JavaScript integrated with HTML and CSS on the client-side. Upon login, trivia enthusiasts may view the game's all-time highest scores, their own scores, or select a category to begin running through a marathon of 26 trivia questions.
